# Governance

## VeritasChain Standards Organization (VSO)

The **VeritasChain Standards Organization (VSO)** is a vendor-neutral, non-profit standards body responsible for developing and maintaining the VeritasChain Protocol (VCP), Content/Creative AI Profile (CAP), and the broader Verifiable AI Provenance (VAP) Framework.

### Mission

> *"Encoding Trust in the Algorithmic Age"*

VSO's mission is to develop open, interoperable standards for cryptographically verifiable AI audit trails, enabling third-party verification of AI system behavior without exposing proprietary information.

## Governance Principles

### 1. Vendor Neutrality

VSO maintains strict vendor neutrality:
- No single vendor controls the specification
- All contributors participate on equal terms
- References to specific products are for interoperability only
- Commercial implementations do not influence normative requirements

### 2. Non-Endorsement Policy

VSO does not endorse:
- Specific implementations of CAP
- Particular vendors or products
- Compliance claims by third parties

Use of VSO specifications does not imply VSO endorsement.

### 3. Open Process

Specification development follows an open process:
- All normative documents are publicly available
- Proposed changes are discussed openly
- Meeting minutes are published (when applicable)
- Decisions are documented with rationale

### 4. Consensus-Based Decision Making

Changes to CAP specifications require:
- Technical justification
- Review period for stakeholder input
- Documented consensus or voting record
- Clear versioning and changelog
